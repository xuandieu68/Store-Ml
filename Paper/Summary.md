# Literature Review

## 1. Introduction

Momentum and profitability‐based anomalies represent two of the most influential challenges to traditional asset-pricing theory. A central question in this literature concerns whether cross-sectional return premia arise from risk compensation or persistent mispricing driven by investor behavior. Four foundational papers—Jegadeesh and Titman (1993, 2001), Chan, Jegadeesh and Lakonishok (1996), and Novy-Marx (2012)—form the core empirical evidence documenting robust momentum and profitability effects in U.S. equities and, by extension, have shaped decades of research in empirical asset pricing. This review synthesizes their contributions, methodological advances, and implications for risk-based versus behavioral explanations.

## 2. Momentum Evidence in Early Empirical Asset Pricing

### **2.1. The Foundational Findings: Jegadeesh & Titman (1993)**

Jegadeesh and Titman (1993) provide the first comprehensive evidence that **intermediate-horizon momentum strategies**—buying past 3–12-month winners and selling past losers—generate **significant positive abnormal returns** even after controlling for size and seasonality. Their methodology, based on overlapping portfolios and Fama-MacBeth regressions, reveals that momentum profits cannot be explained by traditional risk factors of the time. Importantly, their results show **return continuation** over 3–12 months and **return reversal** over 3–5 years, suggesting a behavioral pattern inconsistent with constant-risk models. The interpretation leans toward delayed price reaction or investor underreaction.

### **2.2. Out-of-Sample Validation and Behavioral Interpretation: Chan, Jegadeesh & Lakonishok (1996)**

Chan, Jegadeesh, and Lakonishok (1996) extend the momentum evidence and examine whether the profits stem from **public information** or **market underreaction**. They find that earnings-related news and analyst revisions only partially explain momentum, while a substantial portion stems from **market participants’ slow diffusion of information**, consistent with behavioral models of conservatism or anchoring. Moreover, they show that momentum profits remain strong across industry classifications. Their decomposition of returns into industry and firm-specific components suggests that momentum is both a **market over-reaction to firm-specific information** and a broader cross-industry pattern.

### **2.3. Long-Horizon Tests and Persistence: Jegadeesh & Titman (2001)**

Jegadeesh and Titman (2001) revisit momentum over a longer sample (1990s data) and confirm that momentum returns persist out-of-sample. This robustness—across decades, market conditions, and alternative weighting schemes—rules out data-mining concerns. They also show that momentum profits are **not fully explained by known risk factors** (e.g., size, value), and their persistence during periods of increasing institutional participation suggests a structural feature of investor behavior rather than temporary inefficiency. Their long-horizon reversals reinforce the behavioral overreaction-underreaction cycle: initial underreaction creates momentum, followed by long-term correction.

## **3. Profitability and the Rise of “Quality” as a Factor**

### **3.1. Novy-Marx (2012): The Profitability Premium**

Novy-Marx (2012) demonstrates that **gross profitability**—revenues minus cost of goods sold scaled by assets—is **as powerful as book-to-market** in predicting cross-sectional stock returns. This finding is notable for two reasons.
First, it shows that **high-quality, profitable firms earn higher returns**, contradicting traditional value–profitability trade-off predictions.
Second, gross profitability exhibits **low correlation with value factors**, making it a valuable addition to multifactor models.

Novy-Marx provides evidence that profitability captures a dimension of **intangible capital** and **predictable variation in future cash flows**, while also being consistent with certain mispricing explanations involving investor neglect of fundamental information. His results complement and extend the momentum literature: both anomalies reflect systematic underreaction to information (past returns in momentum; fundamental performance in profitability).

## **4. Thematic Synthesis**

### **4.1. Underreaction as a Unifying Mechanism**

Across all four studies, a consistent pattern emerges:

* **Momentum**: markets underreact to information contained in past returns (Jegadeesh & Titman 1993, 2001).
* **Earnings- and news-related momentum**: investors adjust too slowly to public signals (Chan, Jegadeesh & Lakonishok 1996).
* **Profitability**: investors underweight firms’ fundamental strength (Novy-Marx 2012).

Together, these findings reinforce the view that **systematic underreaction**, not risk alone, drives much of the cross-sectional return premia.

### **4.2. Methodological Contributions**

These studies also advance empirical finance methods:

* overlapping portfolio construction,
* risk-adjusted abnormal return estimation (e.g., Fama-French models),
* decomposition of industry vs. firm-specific signals,
* introducing economically meaningful new predictors (profitability).

The methodological rigor of these papers set standards for modern anomaly research.

## **5. Implications and Research Gaps**

Despite the depth of evidence, several gaps remain:

1. **Risk-based explanations remain unresolved.** Momentum and profitability premiums are difficult to reconcile with standard consumption-based or macro-risk models.
2. **Interaction between momentum and profitability** is underexplored in early literature; recent work (post-2012) suggests complementarity but the mechanism remains debated.
3. **Behavioral microfoundations**—how investor psychology systematically generates these anomalies—remain incompletely modeled.
4. **Out-of-sample and international evidence**, though substantial today, were limited in the original studies and remain an active research area.
5. The role of **machine learning and nonlinear inference** in synthesizing momentum, profitability, and other firm-characteristic interactions has become a modern extension absent from the foundational papers.

## **6. Conclusion**

The four studies reviewed constitute the empirical foundation of modern anomaly research. Jegadeesh and Titman (1993, 2001) establish persistent and robust momentum effects; Chan, Jegadeesh, and Lakonishok (1996) attribute them partly to investor underreaction; and Novy-Marx (2012) introduces profitability as a major return predictor on par with value. Together, they highlight the limits of traditional risk-based models and motivate continuing research into behavioral explanations, information diffusion, and modern multifactor frameworks.
